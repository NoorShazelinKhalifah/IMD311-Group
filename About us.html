	    <h2> SOULMATE'S CAFE</h2>
        
		<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size: 19px">The Soulmate's Cafe was established in 2012 in the Jalan 50, Jalan Opera J U2/J, Taman TTDI Jaya, 40150 Shah Alam, Selangor. The Cafe is open every Monday to Friday, from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. It closed only public holidays, festivals and special holidays. We also have a staff of 15 people.
		</p>
		<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size: 19px">The Soulmate's cafe is an English -themed cafe. Our cafe also has an English -style concept and a theme of pastel colors such as pink, beige, and soft purple. The entire menu consists of western food, from food, drink, and even dessert. We inspire western food and try to highlight in Malaysia. This is because, we tried different things, because as we all know, not many cafes out there sell western food. In addition, customers can also try a variety of western dining instead of boringly eating the same food every day.
		</p>
		<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size: 19px">Apart from that, the meaning behind the name of Soulmate's Cafe is inspired by our friendship. The meaning of soulmates is someone who understand you like no others and will be there for you no matter what. This is related to our friendship. Other than that, a soulmate is also not for a partner only but for oneâ€™s bond of friendship.
